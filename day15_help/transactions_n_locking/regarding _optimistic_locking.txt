Optimistic Locking
When we talk about locking we are often referring to optimistic locking. The optimistic locking model
subscribes to the philosophy that there is a good chance that the transaction in which changes are made
to an entity will be the only one that actually changes the entity during that interval. This translates into
the decision to not acquire a lock on the entity until the change is actually made to the database, usually
at the end of the transaction.
When the data actually does get sent to the database to get updated at flush time or at the end of the
transaction, the entity lock is acquired and a check is made on the data in the database. The flushing
transaction must see whether any other transaction has committed a change to the entity in the
intervening time since this transaction read it in and changed it. If a change occurred, it means that the
flushing transaction has data that does not include those changes and should not write its own changes
to the database lest it overwrite the changes from the intervening transaction. At this stage, it must roll
back the transaction and throw a special exception called OptimisticLockException.
How to enable optimistic locking support in the web app ?
Use JPA annotation ,in your POJO class
@Version
private int version;//any field name
Supply getters n setters.
In case of concurrent changes made to the entity @ flush time(upon commit)
Hibernate throws OptismisticLockException(root cause :
StaleStateException)
